# LearnHaskell
This repo was created for documenting and organizing my progression 
as I learned Haskell. I am learning Haskell via the book "Learn You 
a Haskell for Great Good" by Miran Lipovaca. Keep in mind that much 
of the code in this repo is originally from that book, and I do not 
take ownership or responsibility for any of it. I simply like to 
write and test each example myself as it helps with the learning process.
